# 코워크스페이스 (ko-workspace) Product Spec

## Product Direction

`코워크스페이스 (ko-workspace)` is a static office utility platform for Korean users and general browser-based work. It is designed to host many small, high-frequency tools that solve day-to-day text, image, PDF, subtitle, and voice tasks without requiring account creation or server-side storage.

## Current Shipping Scope

The current deployment targets Cloudflare Pages and keeps all initial tools inside a browser-only execution model.

Core constraints:

- No backend server for core tools
- No database or persistent user storage
- No account system for the current public tool set
- No collection of user-entered work data by the application itself
- No paid external API required for baseline execution
- No private API key exposed to client-side JavaScript
- Tool pages must be directly deployable as static pages
- User work data should be handled as 100% browser-side processing unless a future spec explicitly changes the architecture

## Implemented Tools

## URL Strategy

- Home: `/`
- Tool pages: `/tools/{slug}/`
- Policy pages: `/privacy`, `/terms`

Each tool page should have:

- Unique title
- Unique meta description
- Canonical URL
- Dedicated Open Graph URL
- Browser-side app shell driven by `app.js`

## Frontend Structure

- `index.html`: platform home shell
- `tools/*/index.html`: static tool entry pages
- `styles.css`: shared platform and tool styles
- `app.js`: tool registry, page rendering, and browser-side tool logic

## Deployment Model

- GitHub Actions prepares `.cloudflare-dist/`
- Root files are copied into `.cloudflare-dist/`
- The `tools/` directory is copied recursively into `.cloudflare-dist/`
- Cloudflare Pages deploys `.cloudflare-dist/`

## Security Rules

- CSP is managed in `_headers`
- External runtime libraries are limited to browser-side tool libraries loaded from CDN
- Tool inputs and uploaded files are processed in the browser and not sent to an application server
- The service copy should communicate clearly that work data is not stored by our server and is processed in the user's browser
- The current product does not operate login, membership, or first-party personal-data collection
- Deployment secrets remain in GitHub Actions Secrets or Cloudflare settings only

## Public Contact Copy

Footer and policy pages should expose the same operator information:

- Maker: Dayway / 데이웨이
- Website: `https://dayway.web.app`
- Email: `dayway.ict@gmail.com`
- Advertising, collaboration, and partnership inquiries should be directed to the email address above.

## Remaining Work

- Run manual camera and microphone checks on real Chrome/Edge devices after each media-tool change
- Add compact FAQ sections to high-value tool pages for SEO without crowding the work surface
- Create category landing pages for text, PDF, image, subtitle, voice, and video tools
- Add privacy-friendly analytics events for tool open, run, copy, and download actions
- Tune AdSense placements after approval and keep ads outside editor/upload/drop zones
- Monitor MediaPipe background-effect load failures and add a local fallback if CDN reliability becomes a problem
- Request indexing for new or materially changed tool pages in Search Console

## Open Source Fallback Rule

When a browser-side feature fails functional testing, do not keep expanding fragile custom code by default. First check whether a mature open-source browser library can solve the failing area with less risk.

Selection and fallback details are maintained in `OPEN_SOURCE_FALLBACKS.md`.

## Ad Layout Principle

Ad slots are pre-separated from the work surface.

Prepared slot positions:

- `top-banner`
- `bottom-banner`
- `left-rail`
- `right-rail`

When ad slots are empty, they remain hidden.
