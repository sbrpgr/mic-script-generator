- Updated titles, descriptions, canonical URLs, and OG URLs per tool page

### Implemented Tools

### Security And Deployment

- Kept the initial scope browser-only for Cloudflare Pages static deployment
- Updated `_headers` CSP to allow the minimum required browser-side tool libraries

- Expanded `sitemap.xml` to include tool pages

### Notes

- Initial advanced features such as OCR, background removal, PDF password removal, PDF compression, and AI summary/translation remain excluded from the static-only launch scope
- Ad slots remain separated from the work surface and hidden when unused

### Webcam Recorder Update

- Added optional webcam background effects: blur, solid color, and user-uploaded image background
- Kept background removal/transparency out of scope
- Loaded MediaPipe segmentation only when a background effect is enabled
- Kept uploaded background images local to the browser; files are not sent to an application server
- Updated CSP to allow the pinned MediaPipe CDN and WASM execution needed for browser-side segmentation

### Trust And Contact Copy

- Added public copy that work data is processed in the browser and not stored by our own server
- Clarified that the current public tools do not require membership or first-party personal-data collection

### SEO FAQ And Analytics

- Added collapsed usage examples and FAQ content below Quick Flow for every tool page
- Added dynamic FAQPage structured data from the same visible FAQ content
- Added privacy-safe GTM `dataLayer` events for tool open, run, copy, download, permission request, and FAQ opening
- Documented analytics allowlists in `ANALYTICS.md` so no input text, file names, extracted data, or recording contents are sent
